**`‚ú® i'm looking for a SWE internship`**
- i'm taking my sweet time learning things, i'm not desparate,  <n-trang@outlook.com>.
- objectives
    - apply
      - i want to use what i've been learning in real world projects
      - learn to work in team. even more as a self-taught, i understand the important of community, mentorship, fellowship.
    - explore
      - at this stage i feel like wanting to go more into the product/ bussiness side of tech
      - but i understand the importance of engineering and want to start here. that's a very good base, i think.
      - SWE is also the most common internship, and i hope to maximize my chance. but please tell me if you think of other matching opppotunities. 
    - contribute
      - test-driven, coding styles complied, minimalistic approach.
      - i love writing, taking photos, making videos. i can try "less traditional" tasks, like bloging, making web contents.
      - provide POV of a non-tech-savvy.
- more details:
