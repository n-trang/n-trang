# `hello world ðŸ‘‹, 
my name is Trang. i like making stuffs.

like when you've made something really nice, you feel good. when you've made somthing not that good, there's a resonable-self-back-pat saying you've tried, and that documentation was shiet anyway.

the medium for making could be anything: photos, apps, videos. maybe jokes?
